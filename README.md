# TheFoodDilemma
This repository brings together the code produced as part of a miniproject for a Performance Evaluation course at EPFL.

The project aims to respond to the following two issues:

How does the carbon footprint emitted by our food vary according to our nutrition choices? 

How do global carbon emissions vary if an entire community begins to change its eating habits?
